    "As mentioned in my previous milestone, I don't believe there are any ethical implications for these analyses in general. This analysis will simply consider how different factors impact a player/teams ability to be successful. With that said, the table from Baseball Reference was fairly easy to work with and didn't require much transformation. However, the most obvious change that was necessary was to remove the unneeded rows related to old teams or team aliases. As for the ethical steps taken, yes I believe the data was acquired ethically because Baseball Reference is an affiliate of Major League Baseball. I don't think there are any risks that can arise based on the transformations I have done - if anything my creation of the \"per year\" columns only ensures that each team is represented appropriately considering their time in the league compared to the teams that have existed longer.
